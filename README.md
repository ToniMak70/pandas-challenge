# pandas-challenge
    This assignment had me create and munipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test scores
        in order to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
    My first task was to aggregate the data I was provided and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
        The following key data points are included for the District Summary portion:
            Total number of unique schools
            Total students
            Total budget
            Average math score
            Average reading score
            % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
            % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
            % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

        The following key data points are included for the School Summary portion:
            School name
            School type
            Total students
            Total school budget
            Per student budget
            Average math score
            Average reading score
            % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
            % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
            % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
        
        The Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) results are in descending order
        The Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) results are in ascending order
        The Math Scores by Grade lists the average math score for students of each grade level
        The Reading Scores by Grade lists the average reading score for students of each grade level
        The Scores by School Spending breaks down school performance based on average spending per student
        The Scores by School Size breaks down school performance based on school size
        The Scores by School Type breaks down school performance based on school type
